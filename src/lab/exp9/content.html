The water strider is an insect with a very special ability. It can use its long legs to “grip” the water and then walk on it. What special ability allows it to do so? The water strider uses surface tension, the tendency of the liquid surfaces to act as a stretched elastic film. As long as the pressure of the insect on the water surface does not exceed the force of surface tension, the water layer will not break.<br/>

<br><br>

Surface tension is caused by the attraction between the liquid’s molecules due to various intermolecular forces. In the bulk of the liquid, each molecule is pulled equally in every direction by neighboring liquid molecules, resulting in a net zero force. The molecules at the surface of the liquid are pulled inwards by the molecules deeper inside the liquid and are not attracted as intensely by the molecules of the neighboring medium (be it vacuum, air or another liquid). Therefore, all of the molecules at the surface are subject to an inward force of molecular attraction which is balanced only by the liquid’s resistance to compression, meaning there is no net inward force. However, there is a driving force to diminish the surface area. Thus the liquid squeezes itself together until it has the locally lowest surface area possible.

	<P><A href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/Hbase/surten2.html#c4">Capillary action</A> occurs when the <A href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/Hbase/surten.html#c4">adhesion</A> to the walls is stronger than the <A href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/Hbase/surten.html#c4">cohesive</A> forces between the liquid molecules. The height to which capillary action will take water in a uniform circular tube is limited by <A href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/Hbase/surten.html#c1">surface tension</A>.
