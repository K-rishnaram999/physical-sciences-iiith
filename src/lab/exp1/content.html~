	All matter is made of molecules. What makes the molecules stick together?
	Intermolecular forces hold the molecules together. In some cases they are strong enough for molecules to be very close and in others they are relatively weak 		and molecules tend to fly away from each other. This is why we see different states of matter.<br><br> <p>
	The intermolecular forces are mainly electric in nature.Electrons distribute themselves between and around the atomic nuclei such that in case of asymmetric 		bonds, there is a partial negative charge at one end and a partial positive charge at the other. For example, in molecules like HCl (Hydrogen Chloride), the
	electrons are closer to chlorine nucleus than the hydrogen nucleus, effectively creating a partial separation of charge. This is what is called a molecular <a 		href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_dipole_moment">dipole</a>. A dipole may induce another dipole in a neighbouring molecule by
	attracting the electrons in the neighbour towards its positive end. Generally dipole-dipole interactions and dipole-induced dipole
	interactions make up for most of the intermolecular forces. Dipole moment is one of the keys towards understanding of phenomenon like solubility of substances
	and the states of matter.
	</p>
	</strong>
	<strong> 
	<p>
	A dipole is nothing but a system of two equal and opposite charges (+Q and -Q) kept at a separation (given by vector <b>r</b>). Permanent dipole moments are 		fixed relative to molecular axes. If the vector <b>r</b> points from the negative to the positive charge, the electric dipole is <b>d</b> = Q<b>r</b>. In the SI 		system of units, the unit of dipole moment is the coulomb-m. One typically finds molecular dipole moments reported in Debyes (D). [1 D = 1 x 10 <sup>-18</sup> 		statcoulomb-cm =3.33564 x 10<sup>-30</sup> coulomb-meter].<br/></p>

	The molar polarization can be calculated from the dielectric constant through the Clausius-Mossotti equation:<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P=(&kappa; -1)/(&kappa;+2)[(M/&rho;)]<br>
	where M is the molar mass and ρ is the mass density of the dielectric material.
	The dielectric constant is unitless, and so the molar polarization has units of
	cm<sup>3</sup>/mol.<br>
	The dielectric constant
	at these high frequencies is related to the refractive index by the simple formula:
	&kappa; = n<sup>2</sup>
	where n is the refractive index.<br>
	The contribution from induced dipoles is given by Lorentz-Lorenz equation:<br>
	P<sub>i</sub>=(M/&rho; )[(n<sup>2</sup>-1)/(n<sup>2</sup>+2)]<br>
	The distortion polarizability (&alpha;) is defined as:<br>
	(n<sup>2</sup>-1)/(n<sup>2</sup>+2)=(4&pi; /3)N<sub>A</sub>&alpha;<br>
	Thus we can write the total molar polarization as:<br>
	P=(4&pi; /3)N<sub>A</sub>(&alpha; + &mu;<sup>2</sup>/3kT)<br>
	where μ is the permanent dipole moment of a single molecule, k is the
	Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin. Thus a if P is
	plotted against 1/T it should give a straight line whose slope will
	give us the dipole moment and the intercept will give us polarizability.<br>

<b>Figure 1.</b> a) Main three regions of visible spectrum. b) Three major colors additively combine to produce various colors (in the absence of white background) and white light. (c) Complementary colors. Opposite triangles correspond to the complementary colors. Any color in a triangle is generated by the combination of the colors on two adjacent triangles. (d) Generation of colors by various subtractive combinations of colors (in the presence of white background).
</p>
<p>
The combination of colors producing other colors and complementary colors are given in the form of color polygon in the following figure. The complementary color of red is cyan and of green is magenta. In most of our practical applications such as painting, photography, printing, fabric dying, etc., colors are generated by the subtractive principles. In such cases, one starts with the white background or with the presence of all lights and subtracts some lights from this white light spectrum and observes the combination of other colors coming out of it. Paints, inks, filters, etc. are used to subtract some of the light. In order to understand the color generation by the subtractive mixture principle, we consider the following example. Let us put some ink on a piece of paper. The piece of paper has a white background due to the reflectance of almost all the colors of visible light. The ink will subtract (absorb) some light from this spectrum and will allow reflectance of the rest of the light. Now if we assume that the ink subtracts (absorbs) the yellow color (a combination of red and green color regions), then the red and green colors are absent from the spectrum and mainly blue region of the spectrum is reflected. Therefore the ink will appear blue in color. Similarly a yellow ink reflects red and green light and absorbs blue light. A color subtracts its complementary color. Let us see the following example of a transparent solution. In the following Figure 2, mainly green light is absorbed and its complementary color, magenta, is observed to be the color of the solution.

	6.You may observe that the time period value does not change with initial displacement or even changing the mass of the oscillator. It means Time Period is 		independent of mass of the oscillator and also independent of initial displacement.

	Observation 3: <br/><br/>
	7. Keeping the mass and initial displacement as default values, repeat the experiment by changing the length. <br/><br/>
	8. Make note of the time interval of any one complete cycle from the response graph. You can observe that the Time Period of the simple harmonic oscillator is 		dependent on the length of the oscillator. <br/><br/>
	9. Repeat the experiment by giving different lengths of oscillator and draw the graph between length and time period of the simple harmonic oscillator.
