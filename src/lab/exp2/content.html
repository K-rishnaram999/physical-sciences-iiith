	We all know that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron">electron</a> is a fundamental particle carrying the smallest unit of electric charge. How did people find out what is the value of this charge?<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Millikan did a clever experiment using an oil drop that could absorb positively charged molecular ions. 
A molecular ion with a positive charge is a molecule from which one or more electrons 
have been taken away. The idea is very simple, if you take away one electron, 
the value of the positive charge will be equivalent to that of the negative charge on one 
electron. An oil drop may absorb one or more such ions, thus carry charges 
equal in magnitude to that of either one or two or three, etc., electrons. 
If we apply an electric field, the charged ion will move aligned with the field. 
It is by studying the motion of the oil drop, we can find the 
amount of charge carried. If we do several such experiments and find the common 
denominator of the charges observed, it must be charge of an electron.<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, how did Millikan do it? He used an interesting idea. 
An oil drop if allowed to fall freely in air will be accelerated by gravity. 
However, the viscous drag on the falling drop will do a balancing act 
(as long as the drop is very small, typically of a micrometer radius), 
and soon it reaches a constant terminal velocity, say v<sub>down</sub>
If the electric field is applied in the opposite direction, i. e., vertically upwards, 
the drop is now subject to two forces - gravity (mg) puling it downwards and 
the field (qE) pushing it upwards. The net force qE-mg 
is balanced by the viscous drag of air and a 
terminal velocity upwards, say v<sub>up</sub> is reached.  
Comparing the two velocities, together with a knowledge of the mass, m, 
and the field, E, the charge can be calculated.<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will carry out this experiment 
virtually and learn how it works.<br/>

	The free falling oil drop is acted upon by two forces, the force of gravity and
the upward force resisting its motion due to viscosity. The size of the oil drop
is very small and thus reaches its terminal velocity (given by Stokes' Law) very
soon and the forces are in equilibrium then. If drop's density is <i>f</i>, medium's
density is <i>f<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>a</i> is the radius of the drop and <i>x</i> is medium's viscosity, then the
terminal velocity is,<br/>

where m is mass of the oil droplet and,<br/>

Under electric field the terminal velocity becomes,<br/>

Thus if we observe two successive times of rise (under electric field) for the same
droplet, we can write (considering two different charges were with the drop in
two different times, the charge of a single electron as,<br/>

	5.Repeat the above procedure by changing the initial displacement, mass and observe the time period. <br/>
	6.You may observe that the time period value does not change with initial displacement or even changing the mass of the oscillator. It means Time Period is independent of mass of the oscillator and also independent of initial displacement.
